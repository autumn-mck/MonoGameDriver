# MonoGameDriver

An application I wrote from scratch with several parts:

 - A 2D driving simulation that actually feels fun to drive around in
 - A system for creating and improving genetic neural networks written entirely from scratch to allow me to better understand how simple networks like that actually function

... the end result of which is networks which can drive a car pretty well based on only a few sensors (5 distances to the edge of the track at different angles)
