# MonoGameDriver

An application I wrote from scratch with several parts:

 - A 2D driving simulation that actually feels fun to drive around in
 - A system for creating and improving genetic neural networks written entirely from scratch to allow me to better understand how simple networks like that actually function

... the end result of which is networks which can drive a car pretty well based on only a few sensors (5 distances to the edge of the track at different angles)  
Although the driving aspect of the project is functional, it's still rather buggy and the code itself is a mess. Unfortunately I made the mistake of not doccumenting this code when I initially wrote it, and as a result it's hard to tell what parts of it are actually trying to do. Although this is definitely fixable, I haven't felt like revisiting this project as I'm still happy with the result of experimenting with neural networks, which was the later focus of this project, and this aspect of the project actually works rather well.
