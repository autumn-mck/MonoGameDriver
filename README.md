# MonoGameDriver

![A gif showing a large number of cars driving around a track, with some crashing into the edge and stopping](./imgs/driver.gif)

An application I wrote from scratch with several parts:

- A system for creating and improving genetic neural networks, written entirely from scratch to better understand how these networks function
- A complex 2D driving simulation

The end result of which are networks which can drive a car surprisingly well based on only a few sensors, as seen above (5 distances to the edge of the track at different angles)
